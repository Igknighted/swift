swift
================================================================================
A simplistic web CGI library for C++ in a less than monolithic form!

Features:
- Easy to use functions to set cookies, read cookies, and common request data.
- Supports file uploads in a simplistic manner.
- Has a built in templating system so that you can code first and HTML later.
- Built to easily follow an MVC pattern.

Goals:
The goals of swift are simple and blatantly straight forward. This library is
made to provide a common web developer from PHP an easy way into making quicker
web based applications.

Open Source Statement:
swift.cpp is open source and free to use and redistribute.

Todo:
- Need to make a simplistic deployment interface. This is something that needs to
be usable on even a shared hosting platform without SSH access.

How to compile
================================================================================
Compiling should be as simple as this:
g++ example1_templates.cpp -o /home/username/public_html/example1_templates.cgi

It should run from www.yoursite.com/example1_templates.cgi

You may need to setup apache to execute CGI binaries. 


Examples
================================================================================

All the templates are stored in the html directory.

example1 - this example demonstrates a basic template and how to use the
template blocks. One block is parsed out twice and the other block is not.

example2 - this example demonstrates how to utilize variables in your code with
the template blocks.

example3 - this example demonstrates how to utilize a basic form on your site

example4 - this example demonstrates how to deal with storing a file that has
been uploaded as a part of multipart form data

example5 - this example demonstrates setting and unsetting cookies

example6 - this example demonstrates setting a header to do a redirect. Any
header you want can be set, not just redirects.
